\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\section{Circuits and 2-PROPS}
\label{sec:prelim}

We assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of symmetric
monoidal category; a standard reference is
\cite{MacLane:CatsWM:1971}.  

\begin{definition} \label{def:PROP}
  A \emph{PROP} is strict symmetric monoidal category whose objects
  are the natural numbers, and where the action of the tensor product on
  objects is given by addition.
\end{definition}

PROPs have been used to formalise many algebraic structures
\cite{Lack:2004sf}, however our interest here is to formalise a
general notion of \emph{circuit} made by wiring together certain
atomic operations.  With this in mind, a PROP of circuits is
henceforth a PROP freely generated from some monoidal signature; the
members of the signature are called \emph{gates}, and a circuit is
a morphism in such a PROP.

\begin{example} \label{ex:boolean-circs}
  TODO -- boolean circuits
\end{example}

\begin{example} \label{ex:quantum-circs}
  The main example of interest is \Circ, the PROP of quantum circuits.
  Different authors, and different hardware manufacturers, prefer
  different primitive gate sets but the following is typical:
  \[
  \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
    \circZ{{}} & \qquad  & \circX{{}} & \qquad & \circH \\ 
    \vstrut{1.2em}
    Z : 1 \to 1 && X : 1 \to 1 && H : 1 \to 1\\
    \\
    \circbox{R_Z(\theta)} & \qquad & \circCPhase{\theta} & \qquad & \circCX  \\ 
    \vstrut{1.2em}
    R_Z(\theta) : 1 \to 1 &&  \CPhase\theta :2 \to 2 && \CX : 2 \to 2\\
  \end{array}
  \]
  We omit the usual matrix interpretations but these can be found in
  the standard textbook \cite{NieChu:QuantComp:2000}.  Note that in
  this example we actually have an uncountable family of generating
  gates, one for each value $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$.  Unlike the case of
  Boolean circuits all quantum gates have the same number of inputs and
  outputs.  In fact, \Circ is a \dag-PROP and all its but this will not concern
  us here.
\end{example}

\begin{example}  \label{ex:zx-calculus}
  TODO -- zx-calculus

\noindent
Note that all of these examples usually include an equational theory.
We will don't include these equations in the  definition since we will
model them as higher dimensional arrows.

%%        2-CATEGORY DEFINITION        %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{definition}  \label{def:strict-two-cat}
  A \emph{strict} 2-category $\mathcal{C}$ is a category \emph{enriched over
    \textbf{Cat}}, the category of categories, \emph{viz:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A category $\mathcal{C}$, whose objects and arrows are known as
      \emph{0-cells} and \emph{1-cells} respectively.
    \item For every pair of objects $A$ and $B$, we have a
      category $\mathcal{C}(A, B)$, whose arrows are known as \emph{2-cells}.
    \item For \emph{2-cells} $\alpha : f \Rightarrow g$ and $\beta : g
      \Rightarrow h$ in $\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ their (vertical) composite is denoted
      $\beta \bullet \alpha : f \Rightarrow h$.
    \item For every 1-cell $f:A\to B$ we denote its identity 2-cell by
      $Id_f:f \Rightarrow f$.
    \item For all \emph{0-cells} $a$, $b$, $c$ a bifunctor $\circ:
      \mathcal{C}(b, c) \times \mathcal{C}(a, b) \to \mathcal{C}(a, c)$ called
      \emph{horizontal composition} of \emph{2-cells}.
  \end{itemize}
\REM{Need here the name for a 2-cat with all \emph{2-cells} invertible;  the
  term 2-groupoid refers to the case where both 1- and \emph{2-cells} are
  invertible.}
\end{definition}

\noindent
In the following we'll always write $A, B, C$ for \emph{0-cells}, $f,
g, h$ for \emph{1-cells} and $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ for
\emph{2-cells}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%        2-FUNCTOR DEFINITION        %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{definition} \label{def:two-functor}
  A \emph{strict} 2-functor $F$ between two \emph{strict} 2-categories
    $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ is
  \begin{itemize}
    \item for all \emph{0-cells} $A \in \mathcal{C}$ a 0-cell $F(A) \in
      \mathcal{D}$
    \item for all \emph{0-cells} $(A, B) \in \mathcal{C}$ a functor $F_{A, B}:
      \mathcal{C}(A, B) \to \mathcal{D}(F(A), F(B))$
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent
  Such that $F$ respect the horizontal and vertical compositions.
\end{definition}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%        MONOIDAL 2-CATEGORY DEFINITION        %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{definition}\label{def:monoidal-two-cat}
  A \emph{strict} monoidal 2-category $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ is a
  strict 2-category with a 2-bifunctor $\otimes: \mathcal{C} \times
  \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$.
  \TODO{Denis: fix this definition}
  \REM{What about the unit object?}
\end{definition}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%        INTERCHANGE LAW REMARK        %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{remark}[Interchange law]
\TODO{DENIS : please fix this statement.  THe second and third clauses
  are the same.!}
  Since $\circ$ and $\otimes$ are bifunctorial, we have the following
    interchange equations for all \emph{0-cells} $A, B \in \mathcal{C}$ and all
    \emph{2-cells} $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \in \mathcal{C}(A, B)$
  \begin{align}
    (\alpha \circ \beta) \bullet (\gamma \circ \delta) &= (\alpha \bullet
      \gamma) \circ (\beta \bullet \delta) \\
    (\alpha \otimes \beta) \bullet (\gamma \otimes \delta) &= (\alpha \bullet
      \gamma) \otimes (\beta \bullet \delta)
  \end{align}
  Since $\otimes$ is a 2-functor, we have for all \emph{0-cells} $A, B \in
    \mathcal{C}$ and all \emph{2-cells} $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \in
    \mathcal{C}(A, B)$
  \[
    (\alpha \otimes \beta) \bullet (\gamma \otimes \delta) = (\alpha \bullet
      \gamma) \bullet (\beta \bullet \delta)
  \]
\end{remark}

Putting the preceding definitions together, a 2-PROP is then a strict
monoidal 2-category whose underlying monoidal 1-category is a PROP, or
equivalently, a strict monoidal 2-category whose 0-cells are generated
by a single object under $\otimes$.


\section{Rewriting systems as 2-PROPS}
\label{sec:rewriting}

As remarked earlier we don't include any equations in our notion of
circuits 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%        REWRITING SYSTEM DEFINITION        %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{definition}
  Given a free PROP of quantum circuits, we can extend it to a 2-PROP
    $\mathcal{P}$ where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item gates form the set of \emph{1-cells} 
    \item the \emph{2-cells} are generated by a finite set of \emph{rewriting}
      rules such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 2 rewriting rules with the same types must be equal
      \item each rewriting rule must be invertible, that is $\mathcal{C}(A, B)$
        is a \emph{groupoid} for all \emph{0-cells} $A, B$
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  
  \emph{2-cells} are in general called \emph{rewrite sequence}, but if a rewrite
    sequence has only 1 occurence of a rewrite rule, it is called an
    \emph{atomic rule}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  TODO rewrite sequence \& atomic rule
\end{example}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%        REWRITING SYSTEM PROPOSITION 1        %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
  For all rewriting sequences $\alpha: f \Rightarrow g$, $\alpha$ can be writen
  \[
    \alpha = \alpha_1 \bullet \alpha_2 \bullet \alpha_3 \bullet \cdots \bullet
      \alpha_i
  \]
  
  \begin{proof}
    We'll prove it by induction of the size of the rewriting sequence using the
      properties of the bifunctors.
    With a atomic rule, we already have
    \[
      \alpha = \alpha_1
    \]
    For the inductive step let's assume $\beta$ is
    \[
      \alpha = \alpha_1 \bullet \alpha_2 \bullet \alpha_3 \bullet \cdots \bullet
        \beta
    \]
    If $s$ is such that
    \[
      \beta = (\beta_1 \bullet \beta_2) \circ (\beta_3 \bullet \beta_4)
    \]
    Then using the interchange law we can write
    \[
      \beta = (\beta_1 \circ \beta_3) \bullet (\beta_2 \circ \beta_4)
    \]
    So we have 
    \begin{align}
      \alpha &= \alpha_1 \bullet \alpha_2 \bullet \alpha_3 \bullet \cdots
        \bullet (\beta_1 \circ \beta_3) \bullet (\beta_2 \circ \beta_4) \\
      \alpha &= \alpha_1 \bullet \alpha_2 \bullet \alpha_3 \bullet \cdots
        \bullet \alpha_{i - 1} \bullet \alpha_i
    \end{align}
    Otherwise we can always add an identity rewriting rule to get the
      interchange law.
    \begin{align}
      \beta_1 \circ (\beta_3 \bullet \beta_4) &\Rightarrow (\beta_1 \bullet id)
        \circ (\beta_2 \bullet \beta_3) \\
      (\beta_1 \bullet \beta_2) \circ \beta_3 &\Rightarrow (\beta_1 \bullet
        \beta_2) \circ (id \bullet \beta_3)
    \end{align}
    The same is true with
    \[
      \beta = (\beta_1 \bullet \beta_2) \otimes (\beta_3 \bullet \beta_4)
    \]
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

      \\
    \alpha &= \alpha_1 \otimes \alpha_2 \otimes \alpha_3 \otimes \cdots \otimes
      \alpha_k
  \end{align}
  
  \begin{proof}
    The proof is the same but this time we have to use
    \[
      (\alpha \otimes \beta) \circ (\gamma \otimes \delta) = (\alpha \circ
        \gamma) \otimes (\beta \circ \delta)
    \]
  \end{proof}

      \alpha_i
  \]
  Such that for all $i$
  \[
    \alpha_i = \alpha_{i, 1} \circ \alpha_{i, 2} \circ \alpha_{i, 3} \circ
      \cdots \circ \alpha_{i, j}

  A quantale is a \emph{lattice} with a binary operator such that for all

  \begin{align}
    x \oplus \bigvee y_i &= \bigvee x \oplus y_i \\
    \left(\bigvee x_i\right) \oplus y &= \bigvee x_i \oplus y

  We require that for all $x$, it exist $x^{-1}$ such that
  \begin{align}
    x \oplus x^{-1} &= e \\
    x^{-1} \oplus x &= e
  \end{align}
  
  Such a quantale can be seen as a monoidal category over a \emph{group}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%        HOMOMORPHISM PROPOSITION 1        %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
  Given two rewriting sequence $\alpha, \beta: f \Rightarrow g$, then $V(\alpha)
    = V(\beta)$.
  
  \begin{proof}
    The set of all possible rewriting sequences is freely generated by the set
      of rewriting rules, $\bullet$, $\circ$ and $\otimes$ so both $\alpha$ and
      $\beta$ can be written
    \begin{align}
      \alpha &= \alpha_1 \odot \alpha_2 \odot \alpha_3 \odot \cdots \odot
        \alpha_n \\
      \beta &= \beta_1 \odot \beta_2 \odot \beta_3 \odot \cdots \odot \beta_m
    \end{align}
    with $\odot \in \{\bullet, \circ, \otimes\}$ and for all i $\alpha_i$ and
      $\beta_i$ are rewriting rule.
    If $n = 1$ then $\alpha$ is a rewriting rule, so $V(r) = V(f) \oplus
      V(g)^{-1}$.
    Otherwise
    \begin{align}
      V(\alpha) &= V(\alpha_1 \odot \alpha_2 \odot \cdots \odot \alpha_n) \\
      &= V(\alpha_1) \oplus V(\alpha_2) \oplus \cdots \oplus V(\alpha_n) \\
      &= V(f \Rightarrow h_1) \oplus V(h_1 \Rightarrow h_2) \oplus \cdots \oplus
        V(h_n \Rightarrow g) \\
      &= V(f) \oplus V(h_1)^{-1} \oplus V(h_1) \oplus V(h_2)^{-1} \oplus \cdots
        \oplus V(h_n) \oplus V(g)^{-1}
    \end{align}
    A easy inductive proof can show us that
    \[
      V(f) \oplus V(h_1)^{-1} \oplus V(h_1) \oplus V(h_2)^{-1} \oplus V(h_2)
        \oplus \cdots \oplus V(h_n) \oplus V(g)^{-1} = V(f) \oplus V(g)^{-1}
    \]
    The same is true for $\beta$, so
    \[
      V(\alpha) = V(\beta) = V(f) \oplus V(g)^{-1}
    \]
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proposition}
  The following category $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Q})$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-category
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A set of objects which are the gates of $\mathcal{P}$
    \item For all objects $(f, g)$
  \end{itemize}
  \[
    \mathcal{E}(f, g) =
    \begin{cases}
      \textrm{if } f \Rightarrow g \in \mathcal{P}, &V(f \Rightarrow g) \\
      \textrm{otherwise } &\top
    \end{cases}
  \]
  With $\top \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}$
  \[
    x \preceq \top
  \]
  
  \begin{proof}
    For all gates $(f, g)$, if it exists a unique transformation $f \Rightarrow
      g$, then
    \begin{align}
      \mathcal{E}(f, g) &= V(f \Rightarrow g) \in \mathbb{Q} \\
      &= V(f) \oplus V(g)^{-1}
    \end{align}
    otherwise we already have $\mathcal{E}(f, g) = \top \in \mathbb{Q}$.
    For all gates $f$, we know that there is a identity transformation $f
      \Rightarrow f$ and
    \begin{align}
      \mathcal{E}(f, f) &= V(id_f) \\
      &= V(f \Rightarrow f)\\
      &= V(f) \oplus V(f)^{-1} \\
      &= e
    \end{align}
    Finally, for all gates $(f, g, h)$ such that there exists $\alpha: f
      \Rightarrow g$ and $\beta: g \Rightarrow h$ in $\mathcal{P}$, then the
      homomorphism $V$ give us
    \begin{align}
      \mathcal{E}(f, h) &= V(f \Rightarrow h) \\
      &= V(\alpha \circ \beta) \\
      &= V(\alpha) \oplus V(\beta) \\
      &= V(g \Rightarrow h) \oplus V(f \Rightarrow g) \\
      &= \mathcal{E}(g, h) \oplus \mathcal{E}(f, g)
    \end{align}
    If either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ doesn't exists in $\mathcal{P}$ then
    \[
      \mathcal{E}(b, c) \oplus \mathcal{E}(a, b) \succeq \mathcal{E}(a, c)
    \]
    become
    \[
      \begin{matrix}
        &\mathcal{E}(b, c) \oplus \top &\succeq \top \\
        \textrm{or} &\top \oplus \mathcal{E}(a, b) &\succeq \top \\
        \textrm{or} &\top \oplus \top &\succeq \top
      \end{matrix}
    \]
    which is still true.

\begin{proposition}
  $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Q})$ is strictly symmetric monoidal with $\otimes$, the
    2-functor of $\mathcal{P}$.
  
  \begin{proof}
    The monoidal structure is immediate using the fact that
    \[
      V(\alpha) \oplus V(\beta) \succeq V(\alpha \otimes \beta)
    \]
    that is
    \[
      V(\alpha: f \Rightarrow g) \oplus V(\beta: f' \Rightarrow g') = V(\alpha
        \otimes \beta: f \otimes f' \Rightarrow g \otimes g')

    \[
      \mathcal{E}(f, g) \oplus \mathcal{E}(f', g') = \mathcal{E}(f \otimes f', g
        \otimes g')
    \]
    For the symmetry, we use the fact that $V(f \Rightarrow g) \oplus V(g

    \begin{align}

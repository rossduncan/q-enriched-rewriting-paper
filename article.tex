\subsection{2-Category}

A \emph{strict} 2-category \catC is a category \emph{enriched over \textbf{Cat}}, the category of categories.

\begin{itemize}
\item objects are natural number $\mathbb{N}$, called \emph{0-cells}
\item for all 0-cells $(a, b)$, a category $\catC(a, b)$ with
\begin{itemize}
\item objects $f: a \to b$, called \emph{1-cells}
\item morphisms are called \emph{2-cells}
\item for all 2-cells $r: f \Rightarrow g$ and $s: g \Rightarrow h$, a composition operator $r \bullet s: f \Rightarrow h$ called \emph{vertical composition}
\end{itemize}
\item for all 0-cells $a$ and all 1-cells $f: a \to a \in \catC(a, a)$, there is an identity 2-cell $r: f \Rightarrow f$, written $Id_f$
\item for all 0-cells $(a, b, c)$ a bifunctor $\circ: \catC(b, c) \times \catC(a, b) \to \catC(a, c)$ called \emph{horizontal composition}
\end{itemize}

In the following we'll always write $a, b, c$ for \emph{0-cells}, $f, g, h$ for \emph{1-cells} and $r, s, t$ for \emph{2-cells}.

\subsection{Monoidal 2-category}

A \emph{strict} monoidal 2-category $(\catC, \otimes)$ is a strict 2-category with

\begin{itemize}
\item a 2-bifunctor $\otimes: \catC \times \catC \to \catC$ such that on 2-cells $r, s, t, u$
$$
(r \otimes s) \circ (t \otimes u) = (r \circ t) \otimes (s \circ u)
$$
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}[Interchange law]
Because $\circ$ and $\otimes$ are bifunctor, for all 0-cells $a, b \in \catC$ and all 2-cells $r, s, t, u \in \catC(a, b)$

\begin{align}
(r \circ s) \bullet (t \circ u) &= (r \bullet t) \circ (s \bullet u) \cr
(r \otimes s) \bullet (t \otimes u) &= (r \bullet t) \otimes (s \bullet u)
\end{align}
\end{remark}

\subsection{Quantale}

A quantale $\mathbb{Q}$, over a \emph{group}, is a monoidal category

\begin{itemize}
\item objects are elements of a lattice $L$
\item for all objects $(x, y)$ there is a morphism between $x$ and $y$ iff $x \succeq y$ in $L$.
\item a unit objet $e \in L$
\item a monoidal operator $\oplus: Q \times Q \to Q$
\end{itemize}

\noindent such that for all $x, y \in L$ and $\{x_i\}_i, \{y_i\}_i \subseteq L$
\begin{align}
x \oplus \bigvee y_i &= \bigvee x \oplus y_i \cr
\left(\bigvee x_i\right) \oplus y &= \bigvee x_i \oplus y
\end{align}

We require that for all objects $x$ of $\mathbb{Q}$, it exist an object $x^{-1}$ such that
\begin{align}
x \oplus x^{-1} &= e \cr
x^{-1} \oplus x &= e
\end{align}

\subsection{$\mathbb{Q}$-enriched category}

A $\mathbb{Q}$-enriched category \catE is

\begin{itemize}
\item A set of objects
\item For all objects $(a, b)$, $\catE(a, b) \in \mathbb{Q}$
\end{itemize}

such that for all object $a$
$$
e \succeq \catE(a, a)
$$
for all objects (a, b, c)
$$
\catE(b, c) \oplus \catE(a, b) \succeq \catE(a, c)
$$

\subsection{Monoidal $\mathbb{Q}$-enriched category}

$(E, \otimes)$ is strictly monoidal if
$$
\catE(a, b) \oplus \catE(a', b') \succeq \catE(a \otimes a', b \otimes b')
$$
and symmetric if
$$
e \succeq \catE(a \otimes b, b \otimes a)
$$

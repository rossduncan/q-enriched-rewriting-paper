\begin{abstract}
We formalise an abstract circuit rewriting system as a 2-PROP and,
given a valuation of the 1-cells in a suitable quantale $\mathbb{Q}$,
we show that the rewriting system is resource theory over
$\mathbb{Q}$.  We present some examples of this framework applied to
quantum circuit optimisation.
